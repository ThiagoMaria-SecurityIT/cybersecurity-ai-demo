# AI for Cybersecurity Demo

## Transparency:
- Made with the help of AI 
- Date this repo was created: July 14, 2025  


## This repository demonstrates how AI can detect security threats using:
- **OWASP Top 10** (Common web attacks)
- **CVSS 4.0** (Scoring system for vulnerabilities)

## What This Shows
- üõ°Ô∏è How AI learns patterns in cyber threats
- ‚öôÔ∏è Basic model training process
- üîç Real-time detection examples

  Here's a clear addition for your `README.md` that explains the setup scripts, formatted as a new section:

---

### **üöÄ One-Click Setup**  
Here is the automated setup scripts for all major platforms:  

| Script | Platform | What It Does |  
|--------|----------|--------------|  
| [`setup.ps1`](setup.ps1) | **Windows (PowerShell)** | 1. Creates virtual environment<br>2. Installs dependencies<br>3. Verifies installation |  
| [`setup.bat`](setup.bat) | **Windows (CMD)** | Simple double-click executable for non-technical users |  
| [`setup.sh`](setup.sh) | **Linux/Mac** | Configures everything with terminal commands |  

**How to use:**  
1. **PowerShell**: Right-click ‚Üí _"Run with PowerShell"_  
2. **CMD**: Double-click `setup.bat`  
3. **Linux/Mac**: Run in terminal:  
   ```bash  
   chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh  
   ```  

‚úÖ **Guaranteed isolation** ‚Äì Installs everything in a self-contained virtual environment.

### Suggested Placement  
Add this section right after your project description (before "What This Shows").  

**Why This Matters for Recruiters:**  
- Demonstrates your understanding of **cross-platform compatibility**  
- Shows you care about **user experience** (non-technical users can test your work)  
- Highlights **production-ready practices** (isolated environments, verification steps)  

Would you like me to provide the exact Markdown to copy-paste into your existing `README.md`? I can match your current formatting style.

## Try It Yourself
```bash
python examples/1_owasp_classifier.py
```

## AI in Cybersecurity
- This mimics how SOC analysts train systems to detect:
  - Injection attacks (OWASP #1 risk)
  - Vulnerability severity (CVSS scores)
- Real-world systems process millions of such samples daily
