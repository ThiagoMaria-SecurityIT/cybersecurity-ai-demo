# AI for Cybersecurity Demo

## Transparency:
- Made with the help of AI 
- Date this repo was created: July 14, 2025  


## This repository demonstrates how AI can detect security threats using:
- **OWASP Top 10** (Common web attacks)
- **CVSS 4.0** (Scoring system for vulnerabilities)

## What This Shows
- 🛡️ How AI learns patterns in cyber threats
- ⚙️ Basic model training process
- 🔍 Real-time detection examples

## Try It Yourself
```bash
python examples/1_owasp_classifier.py
```

## AI in Cybersecurity
- This mimics how SOC analysts train systems to detect:
  - Injection attacks (OWASP #1 risk)
  - Vulnerability severity (CVSS scores)
- Real-world systems process millions of such samples daily

  ## Skills Demonstrated
- Model Training: ✔️
- Security Knowledge: ✔️
- Production Readiness: ✔️

  ## How to run:  

  ### Windows:  
Right-click → "Run with PowerShell" or:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\setup.ps1
```
